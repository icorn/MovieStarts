# MovieStarts

MovieStarts tries to solve a problem that I and maybe some other people have: I want to see all currently 
running and upcoming showtimes for movies. There are lots of apps around, but they are either not clearly 
arranged, or (and that's my main problem) they don't have good showtimes for movies in german theaters. 
Most apps simply rely on the data from [themoviedb.org](http://www.tmdb.org), but they are crowdsourced and 
have no reliable german showtimes.

More details will follow.
